# Soundscape Narrative
Rachel Wonder

## My main concept:
**Support your public library...it's not just for books*

##Ideas 
In my visual rhetoric project I want to argue that there are lots of benefits and usages of public libraries, to show 
that there is much more that you can do there than just read books and study. For example, you can do research projects,
play instruments and do crafts, learn new skills such as budgeting and gardening, meet new people through clubs,
listen to guest speakers, learn a new language, watch movies or play games........

##Image specifics

In my final image / product I want to display different people / groups of people alongside a bookshelf (or maybe multiple 
bookshelves) who are engaging in some of these activities. The side of the bookshelf will list the names of some of the activities,
and then the main text of the image will say something like "Support your local library...it's not just about books." 

I kind of want to utilize a more minimalist, cartoonish style (think of the drawings that Duolingo uses, something like that).
