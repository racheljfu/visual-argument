## My title:
**Support your public library...it's not just for books*

## Ideas 
In my visual rhetoric project I want to argue that there are lots of benefits and usages of public libraries, to show 
that there is much more that you can do there than just read books and study. Besides that, you can do research projects,
play instruments and do crafts, listen to guest speakers, learn a new language, watch movies or play games, etc.

## Image specifics

In my final image / product I have displayed different people / groups of people amidst bookshelves
in the Carnegie Library who are engaging in some of these activities. The "divider" between the bookshelf specifies 
some of the activties pictured / other services provided by the library. The main point still remains "Support your
public library."
