## CREATED ASSETS
**Drawn / taken by me**
* I can probably use Photoshop to draw these images, although for the sake of time I don't know how much will be created by me. 
* I might go to the Carnegie Library and take a photo of an area with shelves nearby so my photo has a convincing backdrop 
that I can manipulate.
